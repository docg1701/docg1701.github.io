So this exists now.

Another blog in an ocean of abandoned blogs. But here we are.

This space will document:

*   Technical experiments worth remembering
*   Solutions to problems that shouldn't exist
*   Brief guides when documentation fails
*   Reviews of tools that claim to work

I'm writing this for future me, mostly. If it helps someone else stumbling around the same dark corners of the internet, fine.

Don't expect regular updates.
